# Alphabet Soup Funding Predictions

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a deep learning project for Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation. The project's primary goal is to predict the effectiveness of funding provided to various organizations. To achieve this, we have developed and tested multiple deep learning models that aim to classify whether funding provided to organizations is used effectively or not.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks contain the code and analysis for data preprocessing, model development, and model evaluation.

- **Resources**: Contains supplementary resources, such as images and documents used in the project.

- **Output**: Contains saved model files and artifacts resulting from the deep learning model development process.

- **Resources**: Contains image files that show the performance metrics of the developed models.

## Key Results

We have created several deep learning models to predict the effectiveness of funding, and each model has undergone various optimizations. While we have made significant improvements to the models, we have not yet achieved the desired target accuracy of more than 75%. The models have reached an accuracy level of approximately 72.55% to 72.74%.

## Models Developed

- **Original Model**: The initial model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.59% had a configuration of 8:5:1 with ReLU:ReLU:Sigmoid activations.

- **Model nn**: This model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.74% 

- **Model oo**: This model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.55% 

- **Model pp**: This model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.46%

- **Adjustments**: Model optimization differences adjustments are summarized in the report.

## Recommendations

While the current models have shown promise, further improvements are needed to meet the target accuracy. Recommendations for future work include exploring more advanced neural network architectures, implementing ensemble methods, and continuing to experiment with hyperparameters and data preprocessing techniques. Further data analysis and feature engineering may also help reach the desired target accuracy.
